## Framework
### Left
The left side of framework represents drivers that are used to interact with the Application.
Think of these as the "input" to the application. (REST, CLI, etc.)
### Right
The right side of framework represents connections to external services to drive a behavior.
Think of these as the "output" / "dependency interaction" of the application. (Database, Email Services, etc.)
